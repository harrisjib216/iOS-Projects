Some years ago I completed this tutorial by [Koushan Korouei](https://medium.com/appcoda-tutorials/arkit-domino-knock-down-tutorial-8f63c5f717d6)
to make a AR Dominoes game called [Bricks](https://github.com/harrisjib216/Dominos-ARKit-Swift-Tutorial).

This tutorial is a great introduction to teach fundamentals of AR in Swift if you would like to this this yourself!

Feel free to play my game and let me know what you think!
