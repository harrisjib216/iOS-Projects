# 📱 iOS-Projects

My mono-repo of iOS projects I’ve been tinkering on since 2016

Hey, I’m Jibril, welcome to my iOS playground!

This repo is my “lab notebook” of apps, experiments, and side projects for iOS. 

If you're from the team that built the iPhone — hi 👋 — this is where I show you what I can do.

## 🧰 What’s inside

```
/
├── ObjectiveC/        # Low level experimentation, custom implementations, and completed courses  
├── UIKit/             # View-controller based apps  
├── SwiftUI/           # Modern UI, declarative style  
├── Games/             # Various SpriteKit games
```

## 🦺 Some things I've built:

| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🧠 **AI Projects**         | **AI Coding Tutor (LLM&Ms)**, **BetterRest Sleep Predictor**      | Experiments with large language models and on-device intelligence.                                                      |
| 🎮 **Games (2D & AR)**     | **Hold**, **TaxiTap**, **AR Painter**, **Guess the Flag** | Built with SpriteKit and ARKit — gameplay, physics, and augmented reality .                                  |
| 💬 **Social Media Clones** | **Winstagram4**, **Simple Delicious Recipes**             | Modern takes on social and content-sharing apps; focus on design, data flow, and scalability.                           |
| ⌨️ **YokiBoard**           | —                                                         | A custom multilingual keyboard that translates between English, Spanish, Russian, and Japanese — the languages I speak. |
| 🧩 **UI Experiments**      | **InstaFilter**, **AccessibilitySandbox**                 | Focused on animation, accessibility, and unique interface design challenges.                                            |
| 🧰 **Miscellaneous**       | *And many more!*                                          | Small projects and prototypes exploring architecture, new APIs, and creative ideas.                                     |


## 💡 What I bring to the table

- Depth & adaptability: Comfortable writing code in SwiftUI and UIKit with Swift and Objective-C.
- Architecture experimentation: I love trying out different patterns (MVC, MVVM, VIPER, coordinators, etc.) to see how they hold up in real-world apps. I care about clean boundaries, testability, and modular design — but I’m not afraid to bend the rules if it makes the product better.
- Attention to detail: I obsess over the small stuff — smooth animations, natural state transitions, and interfaces that just feel right.
- Curiosity & growth: Every folder in this repo is a snapshot of something I was learning or exploring. I treat each project like a small lab experiment in becoming a better developer.
- End-to-end awareness: From UI to networking, persistence, app lifecycle, and performance tuning — I enjoy understanding how all the moving parts fit together to make a great experience.
