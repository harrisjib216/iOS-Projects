# 📱 iOS-Projects

My mono-repo of iOS projects I’ve been tinkering on since 2016

Hey, I’m Jibril, welcome to my iOS playground!

This repo is my “lab notebook” of apps, experiments, and side projects for iOS. 

If you're from the team that built the iPhone — hi 👋 — this is where I show you what I can do.

# 🧰 What’s inside

```
/
├── ObjectiveC/        # Low level experimentation, custom implementations, and completed courses  
├── UIKit/             # View-controller based apps  
├── SwiftUI/           # Modern UI, declarative style  
├── Games/             # Various SpriteKit games
└── .gitignore
```

Some things I've built:
- AI Coding Tutor (LLM&Ms)
- 2D and Augmented Reality games (Hold, TaxiTap, AR Painter, Guess the Flag)
- Social media clones (Winstagram4 being most the recent, Simple Delicious Recipes)
- YokiBoard (a custom keyboard that translates text into English, Spanish, Russian, and Japapese, the languages I speak)
- UI Experiments (InstaFilter, AccessibilitySandbox)
- AI Sleep Predictor
- And many more!

# 💡 What I bring to the table

Depth & adaptability: Comfortable writing code in SwiftUI and UIKit with Swift and Objective-C.

Architecture experimentation: I love trying out different patterns (MVC, MVVM, VIPER, coordinators, etc.) to see how they hold up in real-world apps. I care about clean boundaries, testability, and modular design — but I’m not afraid to bend the rules if it makes the product better.

Attention to detail: I obsess over the small stuff — smooth animations, natural state transitions, and interfaces that just feel right.

Curiosity & growth: Every folder in this repo is a snapshot of something I was learning or exploring. I treat each project like a small lab experiment in becoming a better developer.

End-to-end awareness: From UI to networking, persistence, app lifecycle, and performance tuning — I enjoy understanding how all the moving parts fit together to make a great experience.
