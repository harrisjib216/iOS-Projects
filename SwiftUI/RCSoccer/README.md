# ⚽️ RC Soccer - 3D 1v1 Soccer Game

RC Soccer is a fun and fast-paced 3D 1v1 soccer game, inspired by Rocket League! ⚽🚀

Take control of Player 1 (the red square) using WASD, or Player 2 (the blue square) with the arrow keys, and compete to push the soccer ball into your opponent’s goal. The player with the highest score wins!

I had a blast building this project — it was a fantastic opportunity to dive deep into Swift 6, SwiftUI, and RealityKit, experimenting with 3D physics, collision detection, and custom camera systems. Along the way, I learned a ton about game development patterns, entity-component systems, and creating interactive 3D experiences on Apple platforms.

RCSoccer is a playground for both creative coding and friendly competition, and I’m excited to keep expanding it with new features and mechanics.
